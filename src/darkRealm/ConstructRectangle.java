// 492. Construct the Rectangle
//  For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular
//  web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
//  following requirements:
//
//      1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
//
//      2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
//
//      3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
//
//  You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
//      Example:
//  Input: 4
//  Output: [2, 2]
//  Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
//  But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
//  So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

      width--; // we reduce the width till we get a complete divisible
    return new int[]{area / width, width};
