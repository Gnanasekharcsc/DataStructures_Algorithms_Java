//  375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
//  We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
//  I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
//  Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
//  However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the
//  number I picked.
//
//      Example:
//
//  n = 10, I pick 8.
//
//  First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
//  Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
//  Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
//
//  Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
//
//  You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
//  Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
